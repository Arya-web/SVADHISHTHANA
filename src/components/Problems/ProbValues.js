    title: "Rudimentary Infrastructure",
    body: "The current infrastructure for renewable energy generation, transmission, and distribution is often insufficient to meet the increasing demand for green energy.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Expensive",
    body: "Green energy technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems still have relatively high upfront costs compared to conventional energy sources there so discouraging widespread adoption and limits the competitiveness of green energy companies in the market.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Intermittency and Reliability ",
    body: "Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are intermittent by nature, dependent on weather conditions. The lack of consistent power generation poses challenges for ensuring reliable and stable energy supply, particularly during periods of high demand or adverse weather conditions.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "Public Awareness and Education ",
    body: "Despite growing awareness of the need for sustainable energy solutions, there is still a lack of widespread understanding and knowledge about the benefits and feasibility of renewable energy. This knowledge gap hampers consumer adoption and investment in green energy initiatives.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: "Limited Investment and Financing ",
    body: "Securing sufficient investment and financing remains a significant challenge for green energy companies. High front costs of product causes risky investment and questions profitability which further limits the available funding for research and development.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    title: "Scaling and Integration ",
    body: "As renewable energy technologies continue to advance, there is a need for effective scaling and integration of different energy sources. Developing efficient methods for integrating renewable energy into existing grids, optimizing energy storage systems, and fostering synergy between different green technologies is crucial for maximizing their impact and minimizing inefficiencies.",
